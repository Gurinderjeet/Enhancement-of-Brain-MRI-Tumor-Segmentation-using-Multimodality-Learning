# Enhancement-of-Brain-MRI-Tumor-Segmentation-using-Multimodality-Learning
Brain tumor segmentation of Brats 2019 with Multimodality Learning
# Abstract
This research study is  based  on  a  newer approach  to  image  segmentation  of  brain  tumor  images  using Multimodality learning  technique. Multimodality in terms of fusion of four MRI modalities in to one image. This study incorporated  the  state-of-the-art algorithm of the U-Net architecture convolutional neural network  to  successfully  segment  a  brain  tumor  from  several images.  As  a  result  of  this  research  work.
# Proposed Method

Propose  an  automatic  image segmentation  of  Brain  tumor  MRI  using  U-Net  based  deepconvolutional  networks.  This  proposed  method  depicts  threedifferent  phases  namely,  Input  phase,  pre-processing  phaseand the output phase. In the Input phase, we take the dataset consisting  of  high  grade  glioma  data  and  low  grade  gliomas data which are in the format of nii.gz format. There are four different  modalities  for  the  given  namely,  T1,  T1ce,  T2  and FLAIR modalities. Since the image data cannot be processedin the given format, they must be converted into .png format.After  which,  we  have  created  different  image  arrays  of  each modalities including the ground truth data. Once the input database has been fused.
