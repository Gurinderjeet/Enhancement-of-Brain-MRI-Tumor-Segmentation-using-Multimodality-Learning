# Enhancement-of-Brain-MRI-Tumor-Segmentation-using-Multimodality-Learning
Brain tumor segmentation of Brats 2019 with Multimodality Learning
# Abstract
This research study is  based  on  a  newer approach  to  image  segmentation  of  brain  tumor  images  using Multimodality learning  technique. Multimodality in terms of fusion of four MRI modalities in to one image. This study incorporated  the  state-of-the-art algorithm of the U-Net architecture convolutional neural network  to  successfully  segment  a  brain  tumor  from  several images.  As  a  result  of  this  research  work.
