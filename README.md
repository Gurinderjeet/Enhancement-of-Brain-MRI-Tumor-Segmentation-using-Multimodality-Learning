# Enhancement-of-Brain-MRI-Tumor-Segmentation-using-Multimodality-Learning
Brain tumor segmentation of Brats 2019 with Multimodality Learning
# Abstract
Our research study is  based  on  a  newer approach  to  image  segmentation  of  brain  tumor  images  using Multimodality learning  technique. Multimodality in terms of fusion of four MRI modalities in to one image. We have  incorporated  the  state-of-the-art algorithm of the U-Net architecture convolutional neural network  to  successfully  segment  a  brain  tumor  from  severalimages.  As  a  result  of  our  research  work,  we  have  produced the  Dice  coefficient  with  the  new  technique  of  Fusion  of  Inputs with  U-Net  architecture  model.
